1) if number is bigger than 186 then its in the second half of year so number-=186
2) calculate season number by dividing number with 90 (that is the number of days in last 2 seasons) then plus two to it
3) calculate month number by dividing number with 30 (that is the number of days in last 6 months) then plus six to it
4) calculate day number by dividing number with 30 and the division remaining is the answer 
5) if number is smaller than 186 then its in the first half of year 
6) calculate season number by dividing number with 93 (that is the number of days in first 2 seasons) 
7) calculate month number by dividing number with 31 (that is the number of days in first 6 months)
8) calculate day number by dividing number with 31 and the division remaining is the answer
