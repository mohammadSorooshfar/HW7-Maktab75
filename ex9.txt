1)set 2 variables for first and last of the array
2)find the middle using first and last (Math.floor((first + last) / 2))
3)then compare middle element value to the value that we are seeking for, if its equal to middle then we found the index of it
4)if its bigger than middle then put (middle + 1) in the first variables because our value is in the second half of array
5)if its smaller than middle then put (middle - 1) in the last variables because our value is in the first half of array
6)repeat 2-5
